# vite-vue-sandbox
 Just a private Vue sandbox. Uses Vite as bundler.

# Content

This repo contains a default Vite + Vue + Typescript project with components that I test in here.

## About Vite

Vite is frontend build tool valued for its speed:
- It uses Rollup instead of Webpack to speed up bundling,
- It reduces TypeScript processing to only transpiling it(it leaves type checking to your IDE; watch for errors and warnings as you write your code)

# Usage

## After cloning

Go to cloned repository directory and run "npm install" to install Vite and Vue dependencies.

## When you want to test components

Run "npm run dev" for development server(hot module replacement).
